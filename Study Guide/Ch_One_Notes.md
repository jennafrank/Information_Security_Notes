# 🛡️ Chapter 1 Summary: Introduction to Information Security

*CIT 2523 – Information Systems Management, Rose State College*

---

## 🌐 The Role of Information Technology in Business
- Modern businesses depend heavily on IT for core activities like operations, sales, customer service, and recordkeeping.
- IT enables the efficient transportation, processing, and storage of valuable business information.
- Any failure in IT systems (whether accidental or intentional) can lead to major losses—missed shipments, failed deals, and compromised customer trust.

---

## ♻️ The Shift from IT to Information Security
- In the past, tech was managed solely by IT staff and housed in centralized data centers.
- Today, data and devices are everywhere—on laptops, phones, and in the cloud.
- Employees work from home, travel, or connect from multiple locations.
- Security responsibilities must now be shared across the organization, not just confined to IT departments.

---

## 🔐 What Is Information Security (InfoSec)?
- **Definition**: The protection of information and the systems that store, process, and transmit it.
- Covers three core objectives (C.I.A. Triad):
  - **Confidentiality** – Only authorized individuals can access the information.
  - **Integrity** – Information must remain accurate and trustworthy.
  - **Availability** – Information must be accessible to authorized users when needed.
- InfoSec isn’t just about software and firewalls—it includes policies, employee behavior, physical security, and training.

---

## ⚠️ Understanding Threats and Vulnerabilities
- Threats can be natural (floods, fires), accidental (human error), or intentional (cyberattacks).
- Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that threats can exploit.
- Key risk sources:
  - **Internal**: Employees, contractors, misconfigurations
  - **External**: Hackers, competitors, nation-state actors
- Companies must regularly assess risk to prepare and respond appropriately.

---

## 🧱 Security as a Business Responsibility
- InfoSec must be treated as a **core business function**, not a tech afterthought.
- Executives and managers play a crucial role in:
  - Defining acceptable risk
  - Supporting security investments
  - Promoting a culture of accountability
- Communication across departments is essential—security policies must be understood and followed by all employees.

---

## 🏩 The Importance of Policy
- **Security policy** = a formalized statement outlining rules for protecting information assets.
- Policies help set clear expectations and ensure consistency across systems, teams, and procedures.
- Policy must be:
  - Enforceable
  - Measurable
  - Communicated effectively to all users

---

## 🧹 Components of a Complete InfoSec Program
1. **Hardware** – Servers, workstations, firewalls
2. **Software** – Operating systems, security tools, antivirus
3. **Networks** – Communication paths, routers, switches
4. **People** – End users, managers, administrators
5. **Policies & Procedures** – Written guidelines and plans
6. **Data** – The most valuable resource; must be protected wherever it resides

---

## ♻️ Lifecycle of Information Security Management
- A security program evolves over time and includes:
  - **Planning** – Identifying assets and potential risks
  - **Implementing** – Deploying safeguards and training
  - **Monitoring** – Tracking threats, logs, and policy adherence
  - **Responding** – Reacting to incidents and recovering from them
- This is a **continuous improvement cycle**, similar to quality management in other industries.

## 🧱 Principles of Information Security Management

### 🎯 InfoSec vs. IT Management
- InfoSec management shares general leadership traits with IT and business management but focuses specifically on the secure operation of the organization.
- While IT aims for speed and efficiency in data processing, InfoSec prioritizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability—sometimes creating conflicts in priorities.
- The **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)** usually reports to the **Chief Information Officer (CIO)**, which may create tension if upper management doesn’t support security needs.

### 🔑 The Six Ps of InfoSec Management
1. **Planning**
   - Aligns InfoSec strategy with business and IT strategies.
   - Strategic, tactical, and operational levels of planning
   - Types of plans: incident response, disaster recovery, risk management, etc.

2. **Policy**
   - **EISP**: Enterprise-wide guidance
   - **ISSPs**: Rules for specific services (email, web)
   - **SysSPs**: Implementation details for systems

3. **Programs**
   - SETA: Security Education, Training, and Awareness
   - Risk management, disaster recovery, and business continuity

4. **Protection**
   - Risk management activities and safeguards

5. **People**
   - Includes both InfoSec staff and general employees
   - Personal data protection and training

6. **Projects**
   - Each security initiative managed as a project

## 👨‍🏫 Why Learn InfoSec Management? (Henry Bonin Viewpoint)
- InfoSec is growing with more expectations and risks.
- Understanding management roles and responsibilities enhances your value.
- Skills developed: risk assessments, planning, policy, hiring, strategic leadership.
- Managing InfoSec is different from traditional IT project management.

## ⚠️ Threat Categories (Detailed Summaries Coming Next)

### 🚧 Deviations in Quality of Service
- Modern businesses depend on many **interdependent support systems**: power grids, ISPs, water, janitorial services, etc.
- If any of these experience **interruptions** (e.g., weather, accidents, illness), **availability** of IT systems can be compromised.
- **Forms of disruption**:
  - **Internet service issues**: ISP outages can halt operations for remote workers or customer-facing services. Web hosts failing their **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** obligations may cause downtime and reputational damage.
  - **Communications & utility issues**: Loss of phone, water, HVAC, waste removal can shut down operations. Example: Without water, A/C can fail, leading to overheating and shutdowns.
  - **Power irregularities**: Include blackouts, brownouts, spikes, surges, sags, and electrical noise. Can damage networking/computing hardware.
    - Solution: **Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS)** and power conditioning equipment.

### 🕵️‍♂️ Espionage or Trespass
- **Definition**: Unauthorized access to protected information with the intent to gather intelligence.
- **Legal vs. Illegal**:
  - **Competitive Intelligence**: Legal market research.
  - **Industrial Espionage**: Illegal access to sensitive data, often by competitors or foreign governments.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Shoulder Surfing**: Observing someone’s screen or keyboard to steal info.
  - **Social Engineering**: Manipulating people to divulge confidential info.
### 🤖 Hackers
- **Trespassers** that bypass controls using skills, tools, or trickery.
- **Types**:
  - **Expert Hacker**: Knows code, protocols, OSs.
  - **Professional Hacker**: Paid by crime orgs or govs.
  - **Penetration Tester**: Authorized to test systems.
  - **Script Kiddie**: Uses other people’s tools.
- **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)**:

### 🔑 Password Attacks
- Passwords are often the **first line of defense** and thus frequently targeted.
- **Brute Force Attack**:
  - Attacker tries all possible combinations until one works.
- **Dictionary Attack**:
  - Attacker uses precompiled lists of common passwords.
- **Rainbow Tables**:
  - Precomputed hash tables used to crack password hashes.
- **Hybrid Attack**:
  - Combines dictionary + mutation techniques (e.g., pa$$word123).
- **Countermeasures**:
  - Strong password policies (length, complexity)
  - Account lockouts after failed attempts
  - Use of **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
  - Salting hashes to thwart rainbow tables
