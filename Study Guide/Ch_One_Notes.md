# 🛡️ Chapter 1 Summary: Introduction to Information Security

*CIT 2523 – Information Systems Management, Rose State College*

## 🌐 The Role of Information Technology in Business
- Modern businesses depend heavily on IT for core activities like operations, sales, customer service, and recordkeeping.
- IT enables the efficient transportation, processing, and storage of valuable business information.
- Any failure in IT systems (whether accidental or intentional) can lead to major losses—missed shipments, failed deals, and compromised customer trust.

---

## ♻️ The Shift from IT to Information Security
- In the past, tech was managed solely by IT staff and housed in centralized data centers.
- Today, data and devices are everywhere—on laptops, phones, and in the cloud.
- Employees work from home, travel, or connect from multiple locations.
- Security responsibilities must now be shared across the organization, not just confined to IT departments.

---

## 🔐 What Is Information Security (InfoSec)?
- **Definition**: The protection of information and the systems that store, process, and transmit it.
- Covers three core objectives (C.I.A. Triad):
  - **Confidentiality** – Only authorized individuals can access the information.
  - **Integrity** – Information must remain accurate and trustworthy.
  - **Availability** – Information must be accessible to authorized users when needed.
- InfoSec isn’t just about software and firewalls—it includes policies, employee behavior, physical security, and training.

---

## ⚠️ Understanding Threats and Vulnerabilities
- Threats can be natural (floods, fires), accidental (human error), or intentional (cyberattacks).
- Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that threats can exploit.
- Key risk sources:
  - **Internal**: Employees, contractors, misconfigurations
  - **External**: Hackers, competitors, nation-state actors
- Companies must regularly assess risk to prepare and respond appropriately.

---

## 🧱 Security as a Business Responsibility
- InfoSec must be treated as a **core business function**, not a tech afterthought.
- Executives and managers play a crucial role in:
  - Defining acceptable risk
  - Supporting security investments
  - Promoting a culture of accountability
- Communication across departments is essential—security policies must be understood and followed by all employees.

---

## 🏩 The Importance of Policy
- **Security policy** = a formalized statement outlining rules for protecting information assets.
- Policies help set clear expectations and ensure consistency across systems, teams, and procedures.
- Policy must be:
  - Enforceable
  - Measurable
  - Communicated effectively to all users

## 🧹 Components of a Complete InfoSec Program
1. **Hardware** – Servers, workstations, firewalls
2. **Software** – Operating systems, security tools, antivirus
3. **Networks** – Communication paths, routers, switches
4. **People** – End users, managers, administrators
5. **Policies & Procedures** – Written guidelines and plans
6. **Data** – The most valuable resource; must be protected wherever it resides

---

## ♻️ Lifecycle of Information Security Management
- A security program evolves over time and includes:
  - **Planning** – Identifying assets and potential risks
  - **Implementing** – Deploying safeguards and training
  - **Monitoring** – Tracking threats, logs, and policy adherence
  - **Responding** – Reacting to incidents and recovering from them
- This is a **continuous improvement cycle**, similar to quality management in other industries.

## 🧱 Principles of Information Security Management

### 🎯 InfoSec vs. IT Management
- InfoSec management shares general leadership traits with IT and business management but focuses specifically on the secure operation of the organization.
- While IT aims for speed and efficiency in data processing, InfoSec prioritizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability—sometimes creating conflicts in priorities.
- The **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)** usually reports to the **Chief Information Officer (CIO)**, which may create tension if upper management doesn’t support security needs.

### 🔑 The Six Ps of InfoSec Management
1. **Planning**
   - Aligns InfoSec strategy with business and IT strategies.
   - Strategic, tactical, and operational levels of planning
   - Types of plans: incident response, disaster recovery, risk management, etc.

2. **Policy**
   - **EISP**: Enterprise-wide guidance
   - **ISSPs**: Rules for specific services (email, web)
   - **SysSPs**: Implementation details for systems

3. **Programs**
   - SETA: Security Education, Training, and Awareness
   - Risk management, disaster recovery, and business continuity

4. **Protection**
   - Risk management activities and safeguards

5. **People**
   - Includes both InfoSec staff and general employees
   - Personal data protection and training

6. **Projects**
   - Each security initiative managed as a project

## 👨‍🏫 Why Learn InfoSec Management? (Henry Bonin Viewpoint)
- InfoSec is growing with more expectations and risks.
- Understanding management roles and responsibilities enhances your value.
- Skills developed: risk assessments, planning, policy, hiring, strategic leadership.
- Managing InfoSec is different from traditional IT project management.

## 📚 OWASP Top 10 Web App Vulnerabilities (2017)
1. Injection
2. Broken authentication/session management
3. Cross-site scripting (XSS)
4. Broken access control
5. Security misconfiguration
6. Sensitive data exposure
7. Insufficient attack protection
8. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
9. Components with known vulnerabilities
10. Underprotected APIs

## ☠️ Deadly Sins of Software Security

### Web Application Sins
- **SQL injection**: Poor input validation
- **XSS, CSRF, Response Splitting**: Exploit server/client rendering
- **Magic URLs, cookies**: Sensitive state data exposed or manipulated

### Implementation Sins
- Buffer overflows, format strings, integer overflows
- Misuse of C++ features, exception handling, command injection
- Information leakage, race conditions, poor usability
- Poor update processes, excessive privileges, failure to protect data

### Cryptographic Sins
- Weak passwords, poor random number generation
- Using weak or incorrect cryptographic methods

### Networking Sins
- Failure to encrypt network traffic
- Poor SSL/PKI practices
- DNS poisoning and trusting name resolution

## 🚀 Other Key Topics

### ⏳ Technological Obsolescence
- Old systems increase risk (e.g., Windows XP after end-of-life)

### 🚓 Theft
- Physical theft is noticeable; electronic theft is stealthy
- Overlaps with attacks, espionage, extortion, etc.

### 🤝 Blended Threats
- Real-world attacks combine many categories (e.g., Duqu malware)

## 💼 Management & Leadership in InfoSec

### Roles of Managers
- **Informational**: Gather/analyze data
- **Interpersonal**: Collaborate with stakeholders
- **Decisional**: Make judgments, resolve issues

### Leadership Styles
- **Autocratic**: Top-down control
- **Democratic**: Consensus-based decisions
- **Laissez-faire**: Hands-off management
- Good leaders mix styles based on situation

### POLC Management Model
- **Planning**: Long (strategic), medium (tactical), short (operational)
- **Organizing**: Structure people/resources
- **Leading**: Guide teams to meet objectives
- **Controlling**: Ensure progress and apply corrective actions

### Governance
- Strategic oversight by top-level execs or board
- Focus: risk management, performance metrics, compliance

2. **Gather facts and assumptions**
3. **Develop possible solutions**
4. **Analyze feasibility of each**
   - Economic, technological, behavioral, operational
5. **Select, implement, and evaluate**
