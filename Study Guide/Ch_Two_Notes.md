## ✅ Chapter 2 Summary: Compliance – Law and Ethics

### 📌 Key Concepts
- **Law vs. Ethics**:
  - **Law**: Enforceable rules backed by the state.
  - **Ethics**: Socially accepted behaviors rooted in cultural norms. Not legally enforced but morally binding.

- **Moral Foundations in InfoSec**:
  - InfoSec professionals must uphold **trust**, **integrity**, and **confidentiality**.
  - They're guardians of systems, data, and policy — expected to operate above reproach.

---

## 🧠 Ethical Theories & Frameworks

### Types of Ethics
- **Normative Ethics**: What *should* people do?
- **Meta-Ethics**: What *do* we mean by "good" or "bad"?
- **Descriptive Ethics**: What have people done historically?
- **Applied Ethics**: How to apply ethical theories to real-life situations.
- **Deontological Ethics**: Duty-based ethics — intentions matter more than consequences.

### Ethical Approaches
- **Utilitarian**: Maximize good/minimize harm.
- **Rights-Based**: Respect and protect individual moral rights.
- **Fairness/Justice**: Treat all fairly; equality in ethical outcomes.
- **Common Good**: Prioritize societal welfare and vulnerable members.
- **Virtue Ethics**: Embody human virtues like honesty, integrity, courage.

---

## 💡 Ethics in InfoSec

- InfoSec workers access sensitive systems and data — ethical behavior is crucial.
- Misuse risks privacy violations, data theft, and loss of public trust.
- Actions must follow not just rules, but moral expectations.

### Ethical Pitfalls
- **Ignorance**: Not knowing policies or laws.
- **Accident**: Mistakes due to carelessness.
- **Intent**: Malicious or selfish misuse of access.

### Slippery Slope Concept
- Small justifications can lead to serious ethical violations.
- Example: Inspecting packet headers for work → reading payloads out of curiosity.

## 🧑‍🏫 Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics
1. Don’t harm others.
2. Don’t interfere with others’ work.
3. Don’t snoop.
4. Don’t steal.

---

## 🧪 Training, Education & Ethical Decision Making

- **SETA (Security Education, Training, and Awareness)** programs reduce unethical/illegal behavior.
- Real-world scenarios encourage ethical reflection and discussion.
- Education improves uniform understanding of acceptable behavior.

---

## 🚨 Deterrents to Unethical Behavior

To be effective, deterrents require:
1. **Fear of Penalty** – consequence must matter.
2. **Probability of Being Caught** – perceived risk.
3. **Probability of Penalty Enforcement** – must actually happen.

Lack of any one can lead to disregard for rules.

---

## 📋 Standards vs. Laws
- Industry standards guide InfoSec practices (e.g., HIPAA, SOX, FERPA).
- Some are self-imposed but enforceable (e.g., PCI DSS).

---

## 💳 PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- Set by PCI Security Standards Council for orgs handling payment card data.
- Version 3.2 outlines 12 requirements in 6 categories:

### 1. Secure Network & Systems
- Firewalls; default password changes

### 2. Cardholder Data Protection
- Storage protection, encrypted transmission

### 3. Vulnerability Management
- Anti-virus; secure system development

### 4. Strong Access Control
- Role-based access; user ID & auth control; physical protection

### 5. Monitoring & Testing
- System auditing; periodic testing

### 6. Policy Maintenance
- Ongoing InfoSec policies for all personnel

### Key Takeaways:
- PCI DSS is **not law** but widely mandated.
- Failure to maintain compliance often leads to breaches.
- Promotes best security practices and customer trust.

---

## ⚖️ Policy vs. Law
- Policies must be communicated, acknowledged, and enforced.
- Policies = internal laws with due care to ensure fairness and awareness.
- Unlike law, **ignorance of policy can be a defense**—if not properly distributed.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Liability & Digital Forensics
- Organizations are liable for unethical/illegal acts by employees.
- Must show **due care** in defining acceptable behavior and consequences.
- **Digital forensics** helps investigate internal violations or attacks.

> - [Georgia Code](https://www.legis.ga.gov/)
> - [NCSL State Privacy Laws](https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/privacy-and-security.aspx)
## ⚖️ Due Diligence & Jurisdiction
- Organizations must make continuous efforts to protect others—globally.
- **Jurisdiction** allows a court to hear cases based on territorial ties or citizenship.
- Known as **long-arm jurisdiction**—enables trying cases outside local boundaries.
- Injured parties often have home court advantage.

---

## 👮‍♂️ Key Law Enforcement Agencies
- Local law enforcement handles physical threats, but often lacks tools for cybercrime.
- Federal agencies play a major role:
  - **FBI InfraGard**: Public-private collaboration sharing cyber threat info.
  - **DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD)**: Safeguards infrastructure.
    - Includes **FPS, OBIM, OCIA, CS&C, and IP**.
  - **NSA**: Oversees cryptographic defense, cyber ops, and InfoSec outreach (e.g., CAE-CD, CAE-CO).
  - **Secret Service**: Investigates cyber fraud, identity theft, and protects financial systems.

---

## 🧪 Digital Forensics Overview
- Investigates policy or legal violations using data from digital devices.
- Based on traditional forensics: What happened, how—but not always why.
- Focuses on identifying, preserving, and presenting evidence (EM).

### 🔎 E-Discovery vs Digital Forensics
- **E-Discovery**: Finds and preserves EM related to legal actions.
- **Digital Forensics**: Collects and analyzes EM for root cause or legal proof.
- E-Discovery follows litigation; Forensics is part of incident response (IR) when proactive.

---

## 🧭 Forensics Process
1. **Identify** relevant items of evidentiary value.
2. **Acquire** (seize) evidence without altering it.
3. Ensure **authenticity** with cryptographic hashes.
4. **Analyze** in a secure environment (e.g., indexed drives).
5. **Report** findings clearly and accurately.

> 🧰 Chain of Custody: Tracks EM storage, transfer, and access. Essential for legal validity.

---

## 🧳 Evidence Acquisition & Handling
- Create forensic images to preserve original data.
- Use specialized tools (e.g., RF shielding for mobile devices).
- EM may exist on:
  - Removable drives
  - Cloud services
  - Logs and memory

---

## 📜 Policy & Procedure for EM
- Strong policy minimizes legal risk.
- Must define:
  - Who conducts/authorizes investigations
  - Search/documentation requirements
  - Evidence handling methods
  - Report formats

> 📂 Supporting docs: NIJ guides, DOJ manuals, CERT resources

---

## 🚔 Law Enforcement Involvement
**Pros:**
- Advanced equipment and forensic skills
- Legal warrant/subpoena support
- Help in building criminal cases

**Cons:**
- May seize business-critical systems
- Slower timelines due to backlogs
- Loss of control over incident narrative

> ❗Mandatory reporting of criminal acts is essential to avoid legal consequences.
