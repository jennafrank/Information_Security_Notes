## ‚úÖ Chapter 2 Summary: Compliance ‚Äì Law and Ethics

### üìå Key Concepts
- **Law vs. Ethics**:
  - **Law**: Enforceable rules backed by the state.
  - **Ethics**: Socially accepted behaviors rooted in cultural norms. Not legally enforced but morally binding.

- **Moral Foundations in InfoSec**:
  - InfoSec professionals must uphold **trust**, **integrity**, and **confidentiality**.
  - They're guardians of systems, data, and policy ‚Äî expected to operate above reproach.

---

## üß† Ethical Theories & Frameworks

### Types of Ethics
- **Normative Ethics**: What *should* people do?
- **Meta-Ethics**: What *do* we mean by "good" or "bad"?
- **Descriptive Ethics**: What have people done historically?
- **Applied Ethics**: How to apply ethical theories to real-life situations.
- **Deontological Ethics**: Duty-based ethics ‚Äî intentions matter more than consequences.

### Ethical Approaches
- **Utilitarian**: Maximize good/minimize harm.
- **Rights-Based**: Respect and protect individual moral rights.
- **Fairness/Justice**: Treat all fairly; equality in ethical outcomes.
- **Common Good**: Prioritize societal welfare and vulnerable members.
- **Virtue Ethics**: Embody human virtues like honesty, integrity, courage.

---

## üí° Ethics in InfoSec

- InfoSec workers access sensitive systems and data ‚Äî ethical behavior is crucial.
- Misuse risks privacy violations, data theft, and loss of public trust.
- Actions must follow not just rules, but moral expectations.

### Ethical Pitfalls
- **Ignorance**: Not knowing policies or laws.
- **Accident**: Mistakes due to carelessness.
- **Intent**: Malicious or selfish misuse of access.

### Slippery Slope Concept
- Small justifications can lead to serious ethical violations.
- Example: Inspecting packet headers for work ‚Üí reading payloads out of curiosity.

## üß™ Training, Education & Ethical Decision Making

- **SETA (Security Education, Training, and Awareness)** programs reduce unethical/illegal behavior.
- Real-world scenarios encourage ethical reflection and discussion.
- Education improves uniform understanding of acceptable behavior.

---

## üö® Deterrents to Unethical Behavior

To be effective, deterrents require:
1. **Fear of Penalty** ‚Äì consequence must matter.
2. **Probability of Being Caught** ‚Äì perceived risk.
3. **Probability of Penalty Enforcement** ‚Äì must actually happen.

Lack of any one can lead to disregard for rules.

  2. Act honorably, legally, and responsibly.
  3. Provide diligent and competent service.
  4. Advance and protect the profession.

---

## üîö Final Notes
- InfoSec professionals must act with the highest ethical standards.
- Ethics training, policies, and codes of conduct help uphold these standards.
- Professional integrity builds long-term trust and career success.

---

## üìã Standards vs. Laws
- Industry standards guide InfoSec practices (e.g., HIPAA, SOX, FERPA).
- Some are self-imposed but enforceable (e.g., PCI DSS).

---

## üí≥ PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- Set by PCI Security Standards Council for orgs handling payment card data.
- Version 3.2 outlines 12 requirements in 6 categories:

### 1. Secure Network & Systems
- Firewalls; default password changes

### 2. Cardholder Data Protection
- Storage protection, encrypted transmission

### 3. Vulnerability Management
- Anti-virus; secure system development

### 4. Strong Access Control
- Role-based access; user ID & auth control; physical protection

### 5. Monitoring & Testing
- System auditing; periodic testing

### 6. Policy Maintenance
- Ongoing InfoSec policies for all personnel

### Key Takeaways:
- PCI DSS is **not law** but widely mandated.
- Failure to maintain compliance often leads to breaches.
- Promotes best security practices and customer trust.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Policy vs. Law
- Policies must be communicated, acknowledged, and enforced.
- Policies = internal laws with due care to ensure fairness and awareness.
- Unlike law, **ignorance of policy can be a defense**‚Äîif not properly distributed.

---

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Liability & Digital Forensics
- Organizations are liable for unethical/illegal acts by employees.
- Must show **due care** in defining acceptable behavior and consequences.
- **Digital forensics** helps investigate internal violations or attacks.

> - [Georgia Code](https://www.legis.ga.gov/)
> - [NCSL State Privacy Laws](https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/privacy-and-security.aspx)
## ‚öñÔ∏è Due Diligence & Jurisdiction
- Organizations must make continuous efforts to protect others‚Äîglobally.
- **Jurisdiction** allows a court to hear cases based on territorial ties or citizenship.
- Known as **long-arm jurisdiction**‚Äîenables trying cases outside local boundaries.
- Injured parties often have home court advantage.

---

## üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Key Law Enforcement Agencies
- Local law enforcement handles physical threats, but often lacks tools for cybercrime.
- Federal agencies play a major role:
  - **FBI InfraGard**: Public-private collaboration sharing cyber threat info.
  - **DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD)**: Safeguards infrastructure.
    - Includes **FPS, OBIM, OCIA, CS&C, and IP**.
  - **NSA**: Oversees cryptographic defense, cyber ops, and InfoSec outreach (e.g., CAE-CD, CAE-CO).
  - **Secret Service**: Investigates cyber fraud, identity theft, and protects financial systems.

---

## üß™ Digital Forensics Overview
- Investigates policy or legal violations using data from digital devices.
- Based on traditional forensics: What happened, how‚Äîbut not always why.
- Focuses on identifying, preserving, and presenting evidence (EM).

### üîé E-Discovery vs Digital Forensics
- **E-Discovery**: Finds and preserves EM related to legal actions.
- **Digital Forensics**: Collects and analyzes EM for root cause or legal proof.
- E-Discovery follows litigation; Forensics is part of incident response (IR) when proactive.

---

## üß≠ Forensics Process
1. **Identify** relevant items of evidentiary value.
2. **Acquire** (seize) evidence without altering it.
3. Ensure **authenticity** with cryptographic hashes.
4. **Analyze** in a secure environment (e.g., indexed drives).
5. **Report** findings clearly and accurately.

> üß∞ Chain of Custody: Tracks EM storage, transfer, and access. Essential for legal validity.

---

## üß≥ Evidence Acquisition & Handling
- Create forensic images to preserve original data.
- Use specialized tools (e.g., RF shielding for mobile devices).
- EM may exist on:
  - Removable drives
  - Cloud services
  - Logs and memory

---

## üìú Policy & Procedure for EM
- Strong policy minimizes legal risk.
- Must define:
  - Who conducts/authorizes investigations
  - Search/documentation requirements
  - Evidence handling methods
  - Report formats

> üìÇ Supporting docs: NIJ guides, DOJ manuals, CERT resources

---

## üöî Law Enforcement Involvement
**Pros:**
- Advanced equipment and forensic skills
- Legal warrant/subpoena support
- Help in building criminal cases

**Cons:**
- May seize business-critical systems
- Slower timelines due to backlogs
- Loss of control over incident narrative

> ‚ùóMandatory reporting of criminal acts is essential to avoid legal consequences.

## üìù Chapter 2 ‚Äì Key Takeaways
- Deterrence requires penalties, certainty of apprehension, and enforcement.
- Laws are enforceable; ethics are not‚Äîbut both influence policy.
- Policy = enforceable rules inside orgs. Must be understood and uniformly applied.
- Digital forensics = vital for both **internal protection** and **legal defense**.
- Legal agencies and structured processes safeguard info and ensure accountability.
