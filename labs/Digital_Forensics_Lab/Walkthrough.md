## Exercise 3 - Analysis Example

### Objective

Identify key evidence by searching for keywords such as `fragment` and `1cro`.

### Tasks

* Start project `C1Prj02`
* Load image: `FATSearchTestImage.eve`
* Perform keyword search for `fragment`
* Export search report as `Ch1Prj02Report`

### Additional Keyword Search

* New project: `C1Prj03`
* Search for: `1cro`
* View images in Gallery View

**ðŸ“¸ Screenshot:** Search results for `fragment` and `1cro`

## Exercise 4 - Allocated & Unallocated Files

### Task 1: Allocated Data Extraction

* Create project: `C1Prj04`
* Load `PhysicalDrive1`
* Sort files by `Deleted` column
* Copy files with `Deleted: NO`

### Task 2: Unallocated File Reporting

* Create project: `C1Prj04`
* Select deleted files
* Add meaningful `Investigator Comments`

## Exercise 5 - Keyword Search Example

### Task: Perform multi-keyword search

1. Start project
2. Load `PhysicalDrive1`
3. Search keywords:

   * `plabwin810`
   * `shell`
4. Review and comment on interesting results
5. Export report

**ðŸ“¸ Screenshot:** Keyword search results

## Summary

Throughout this lab, we covered:

* Image acquisition and MD5 validation
* Analyzing active and deleted data
* Using keyword search for forensic relevance
* Creating and exporting reports in `.RTF` and `.XPS` formats

All screenshots should be saved in `/screenshots/`, and exported reports in `/reports/` folders for GitHub.
