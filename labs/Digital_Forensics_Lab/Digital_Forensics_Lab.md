## 📌 About This Lab

This project simulates a professional digital forensic investigation using **ProDiscover Basic**. It walks through each phase of the forensic process—from acquiring an image of the evidence media to analyzing the data and generating court-ready reports.

As a former salon and spa owner turned cybersecurity student, this lab helped me apply my customer-focused attention to detail in a new setting: the digital investigation space. Preserving evidence, analyzing logs, and building a narrative is surprisingly similar to protecting trust and documenting services in the beauty industry.
