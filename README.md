### ✅ 📄 Featured Research Paper: ISO + NIST

This repo includes a full-length research paper titled
**“Exploring ISO and NIST Frameworks for Organizational Excellence,”** written for my *Information Systems Management* course at Rose State College.

The paper explores how internationally recognized frameworks like **ISO 9001**, **ISO/IEC 27001**, and the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** guide organizations toward better risk management, stronger security postures, and long-term operational success.
